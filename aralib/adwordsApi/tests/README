Unit tests to use with the client library. The appropriate unit test should be
executed whenever you make changes to any of the core library's sources.

The examples for image ads, video ads, and mobile ads to test against
(i.e. ad_group_ad_service_unittest.py) can be found at
http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/static.py?page=imagesamples.html,
http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/static.py?page=videosamples.html, and
http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/static.py?page=mobileimagesamples.html.

By default, all unit tests are (and should be) executed against Sandbox
environment.

To run all unit tests, execute "alltests.py" script. The required data files are
located in "data/".
